## Project Overview
This project is a polling application where users can create polls, view poll results, and, in the future, vote on options. Built using Node.js and the Hapi.js framework, the application includes core features like user registration and authentication with JWT, and CRUD operations for polls.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: For server-side runtime environment.
- **Hapi.js**: As the web framework for building the API.
- **MySQL**: To store users, polls, poll options, and votes data.
- **Sequelize**: As the ORM for database models and relationships.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication and authorization.
- **bcrypt**: For secure password hashing.

## Learning Purpose
This project is part of a learning exercise aimed at building backend development skills using Node.js and the Hapi framework, following the book **"Practical hapi: Build Your Own hapi Apps and Learn from Industry Case Studies"**. While the application demonstrates basic functionality, it is still in the development and refinement phase.

At this stage, the voting functionality has not yet been implemented. The project is a work in progress, with areas such as logging and optimal folder structure still to be improved.
